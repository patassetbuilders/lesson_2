1 a method that returns the sum of two integers
===============================================

Assumption - the method willbe used by other code that get variables

set up method definition
check that input are integers
add integers
end method definition

START
define method constructor
add integers
PINIT INTEGERS
end method constructor
END



2 write a method that takes an array of strings and returns a string concatenated together
==========================================================================================
Assumption - the method willbe used by other code that gives it the code

set up method definition
set up empty string variable 
get the first element of the array
assign the first value to the string
get the next value
concatenate the new value to to the variable
repeat the process until there are no more elements
print the result  

START
SETUp method definition
SET counter variable to length of the array - 1
SET empty string variable
ASSIGN valie to first element to string variable
SET UP WHILE LOOP 
  While current index is less than counter
  READ next variable
  concatenate this variable to string variable
  end loop
READ final string variable
END  method definition


2 write a method that takes returns a new array with every other element
==========================================================================================
Assumption - the method willbe used by other code that gives it the code

Setup method definition
set up empty array
for each elemet of the array
 chech the index if it is odd then add this element to the new array
 if the index is even do nothing
return new array

START
SET method definition  (input array)
SET empty array
for eact element of the array check the index
IF index is odd then add the element to the new array
PRINT new array
